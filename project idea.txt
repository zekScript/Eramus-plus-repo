So the project idea is about creating a article like blog and posting it to the main page list


and everyone can review it by clicking on it but at the same time making it into an portfolio


So for every markdown page written type in terminal this: git commit -m "Made new page"
Then: git push originCopy ArmandasCode to github, then redeploy on varcel and then there should be a markdown page written
