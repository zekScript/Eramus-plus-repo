# Getting Started with Next.js for Beginners

Next.js is a popular framework built on top of React that simplifies the development of fast, scalable web applications. With features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and automatic code splitting, Next.js makes it easy to build optimized web apps. In this guide, we'll walk through the basics of getting started with Next.js.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into Next.js, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: You'll need Node.js (version 12.0 or above) installed on your machine. You can check if Node.js is installed by running `node -v` in your terminal.
- **npm or yarn**: Next.js uses npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn to manage dependencies. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) if you haven't already.

## Setting Up a New Next.js Project

1. **Create a new Next.js app**:
   To start, use the following command to create a new Next.js project:
