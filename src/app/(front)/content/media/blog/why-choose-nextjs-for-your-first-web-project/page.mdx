# Why Choose Next.js for Your First Web Project?

Starting your web development journey can feel overwhelming, especially with so many frameworks to choose from. Next.js, a powerful React framework, is one of the best options for beginners. Here’s why:

## 1. Simplified Routing

Next.js eliminates the need for complex routing configurations. Simply create a file in the `pages/` directory, and it automatically becomes a route. For example:

- `pages/index.js` -> `/`
- `pages/about.js` -> `/about`

This intuitive system lets you focus more on building features and less on setup.

## 2. SEO Optimization Out of the Box

Unlike traditional single-page applications (SPAs), Next.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). These features allow search engines to crawl your site easily, improving your SEO performance.

## 3. Built-in Styling Options

Next.js supports various styling methods, including:

- **CSS Modules** for scoped styling
- **Global CSS** for consistent branding
- Integration with libraries like Tailwind CSS and styled-components

You can choose what works best for your project.

## 4. API Routes Made Easy

Need a backend for your app? Next.js includes API routes. Create files in the `pages/api/` folder, and they automatically become serverless functions. Here’s a simple example:

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Hello, world!" });
}
